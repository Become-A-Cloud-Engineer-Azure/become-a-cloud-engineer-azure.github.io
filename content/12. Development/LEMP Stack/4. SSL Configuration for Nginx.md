## 🎯 Goal

Configure SSL/TLS encryption for your LEMP stack application using Nginx SSL offloading, providing secure HTTPS connections for your web application and phpMyAdmin interface.

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before beginning this tutorial, you should:

- Have completed Tutorial 1: Manual LEMP Stack Installation
- Have a working Nginx web server serving your application
- Have SSH access to your Ubuntu VM
- Understand basic concepts of SSL/TLS encryption
- **Recommended**: Configure your VM with a **static public IP address** (see note below)
- **For Part 2 (Let's Encrypt)**: Own a registered domain name pointing to your VM's public IP

> ⚠️ **Important: Static IP Recommendation**
>
> For SSL certificates, especially Let's Encrypt, it's **highly recommended** to use a **static public IP address** for your VM instead of dynamic IP allocation. Here's why:
>
> - **Domain DNS consistency**: Your domain's DNS records need to point to a stable IP address
> - **Certificate renewal**: Let's Encrypt validates domain ownership using your IP address
> - **Avoided downtime**: Dynamic IPs can change during VM restarts, breaking your domain resolution
> - **Simplified management**: No need to update DNS records when IP changes
>
> **How to configure static IP**:
> - In your Azure Bicep template, change `publicIpAllocationMethod` from `'Dynamic'` to `'Static'`
> - Or in Azure Portal: Go to your VM → Networking → Public IP → Configuration → Assignment: Static
> - **Note**: Static IPs may incur small additional costs (~$0.005/hour when not attached to running resource)

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

- Understand **SSL/TLS concepts** and certificate types
- Create and configure **self-signed certificates** for development/testing
- Install and configure **Let's Encrypt certificates** for production use
- Configure **Nginx SSL offloading** with proper security headers
- Implement **HTTP to HTTPS redirection** for secure access
- Set up **automatic certificate renewal** for Let's Encrypt
- Understand **SSL security best practices** and common configurations

## 🔍 Why This Matters

In real-world applications, SSL/TLS encryption is crucial because:

- It protects data in transit between users and your server
- It's required for compliance with security standards and regulations
- It builds user trust and improves SEO rankings
- It prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception
- It's essential for secure login systems and sensitive data handling
- Modern browsers mark non-HTTPS sites as "not secure"

## Part 1: Self-Signed Certificates (Development/Testing)

Self-signed certificates are perfect for development environments and internal testing where you need encryption but don't require public trust.

### Step 1: Create Self-Signed SSL Certificate

1. Create a directory for SSL certificates:

   ```bash
   sudo mkdir -p /etc/nginx/ssl
   sudo chmod 700 /etc/nginx/ssl
   ```

2. Generate a private key and self-signed certificate:

   ```bash
   sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
       -keyout /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.key \
       -out /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.crt
   ```

3. When prompted, enter the following information:
   - **Country Name**: Your country code (e.g., `US`, `GB`, `NO`)
   - **State/Province**: Your state or province
   - **City**: Your city
   - **Organization**: Your organization name (can be anything for testing)
   - **Organizational Unit**: Your department (optional)
   - **Common Name**: **IMPORTANT** - Use your VM's public IP or FQDN
   - **Email**: Your email address

4. Create a Diffie-Hellman group for enhanced security:

   ```bash
   sudo openssl dhparam -out /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem 2048
   ```

5. Set proper permissions for the SSL files:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod 600 /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.key
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.crt
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem
   ```

> 💡 **Information**
>
> - **-x509**: Creates a self-signed certificate instead of a certificate request
> - **-nodes**: Creates a key without a passphrase (no encryption)
> - **-days 365**: Certificate valid for one year
> - **RSA 2048**: Uses 2048-bit RSA encryption (secure for most purposes)
> - **Common Name**: Must match the domain/IP you'll use to access the site

### Step 2: Configure Nginx for SSL with Self-Signed Certificate

1. Create an SSL configuration snippet:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/snippets/ssl-params.conf
   ```

2. Add SSL security parameters:

   ```nginx
   # SSL Security Configuration
   ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
   ssl_prefer_server_ciphers on;
   ssl_ciphers ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384;
   ssl_ecdh_curve secp384r1;
   ssl_session_timeout 10m;
   ssl_session_cache shared:SSL:10m;
   ssl_session_tickets off;
   ssl_stapling on;
   ssl_stapling_verify on;
   resolver 8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4 valid=300s;
   resolver_timeout 5s;
   
   # Security Headers
   add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
   add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
   add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
   add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
   add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
   
   # Diffie-Hellman parameter for DHE ciphersuites
   ssl_dhparam /etc/nginx/ssl/dhparam.pem;
   ```

3. Create a self-signed certificate snippet:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/snippets/self-signed.conf
   ```

4. Add the certificate paths:

   ```nginx
   ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.crt;
   ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx-selfsigned.key;
   ```

5. Update the main Nginx configuration to support SSL:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```

6. Replace the configuration with SSL-enabled version:

   ```nginx
   # HTTP Server - Redirect to HTTPS
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name _;
       return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
   }
   
   # HTTPS Server
   server {
       listen 443 ssl http2;
       server_name _;
       
       # SSL Configuration
       include snippets/self-signed.conf;
       include snippets/ssl-params.conf;
       
       root /var/www/html;
       index index.php index.html index.nginx-debian.html;
       
       # Main application
       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
       
       # PHP processing
       location ~ \.php$ {
           include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
           fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
       }
       
       # phpMyAdmin with SSL
       location /phpmyadmin {
           auth_basic "Admin Area";
           auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
           
           root /var/www/html;
           
           location ~ ^/phpmyadmin/(.+\.php)$ {
               try_files $uri =404;
               root /var/www/html;
               include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
               fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
               fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
               include fastcgi_params;
           }
           
           location ~* ^/phpmyadmin/(.+\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|css|png|js|ico|html|xml|txt))$ {
               root /var/www/html;
           }
       }
       
       # Security: Deny access to sensitive files
       location ~ /\.(ht|git|svn) {
           deny all;
       }
   }
   ```

7. Test the Nginx configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   ```

8. If the test passes, reload Nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### Step 3: Update Firewall for HTTPS

1. Allow HTTPS traffic through the firewall:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTPS'
   ```

2. Verify firewall rules:

   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   ```

3. **IMPORTANT: Update Azure Network Security Group**

   The tutorial firewall (ufw) only controls traffic within the VM. You must also open port 443 in Azure's Network Security Group:

   **Option A: Azure Portal**
   - Go to Azure Portal → Your VM → Networking → Network Security Group
   - Click "Add inbound port rule"
   - Set: Source: Any, Source port ranges: *, Destination: Any, Service: HTTPS, Action: Allow
   - Priority: 1010, Name: "Allow-HTTPS"

   **Option B: Azure CLI**
   ```bash
   # Get your resource group and NSG name
   az vm show --resource-group <your-rg> --name <your-vm> --query "networkProfile.networkInterfaces[0].id" -o tsv
   
   # Add HTTPS rule
   az network nsg rule create \
     --resource-group <your-rg> \
     --nsg-name <your-nsg> \
     --name Allow-HTTPS \
     --protocol tcp \
     --priority 1010 \
     --destination-port-range 443 \
     --access allow
   ```

   **Option C: If using Bicep templates**
   Add this security rule to your NSG:
   ```bicep
   {
     name: 'Allow-HTTPS'
     properties: {
       priority: 1010
       access: 'Allow'
       direction: 'Inbound'
       destinationPortRange: '443'
       protocol: 'Tcp'
       sourcePortRange: '*'
       sourceAddressPrefix: '*'
       destinationAddressPrefix: '*'
     }
   }
   ```

### Step 4: Test Self-Signed SSL Certificate

1. Open your browser and navigate to:

   ```
   https://<VM_Public_IP>
   ```

2. You'll see a browser warning about the untrusted certificate - this is expected for self-signed certificates.

3. Click "Advanced" and "Proceed to [IP address] (unsafe)" to access your site.

4. Verify HTTPS is working:
   - Lock icon should appear in address bar (may show "Not Secure" due to self-signed nature)
   - Your contact form should work over HTTPS
   - phpMyAdmin should be accessible at `https://<VM_Public_IP>/phpmyadmin`

✅ **Part 1 Complete!** 

Your site now has SSL encryption using a self-signed certificate. While browsers will show warnings, the traffic between users and your server is encrypted.

---

## Part 2: Let's Encrypt Certificates (Production)

Let's Encrypt provides free, automated SSL certificates that are trusted by all major browsers. **This requires a registered domain name.**

> 🚨 **CRITICAL: Azure Network Security Group Requirement**
>
> **Before starting Let's Encrypt setup**, you MUST open port 443 (HTTPS) in your Azure Network Security Group, otherwise HTTPS will not work from external clients even though the certificate is installed correctly.
>
> **Quick Fix**: Go to Azure Portal → Your VM → Networking → Add inbound port rule → Service: HTTPS → Allow
>
> This is the most common issue when setting up SSL on Azure VMs!

### Prerequisites for Let's Encrypt

Before proceeding with Part 2, you **must have**:

1. **A registered domain name** (e.g., `example.com`, `mysite.org`)
2. **DNS records configured** to point your domain to your VM's public IP:
   - `A` record for `yourdomain.com` → `VM_Public_IP`
   - `A` record for `www.yourdomain.com` → `VM_Public_IP` (optional)
3. **Domain propagation completed** (may take up to 24 hours after DNS changes)

> ⚠️ **Important Domain Requirement**
>
> Let's Encrypt **cannot issue certificates for IP addresses** - you must have a domain name. Free options include:
> - Freenom (free domains like .tk, .ml)
> - No-IP (free subdomains)
> - DuckDNS (free dynamic DNS)
> - GitHub Pages custom domains

### Step 5: Install Certbot for Let's Encrypt

1. Install Certbot and the Nginx plugin:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-nginx -y
   ```

2. Verify Certbot installation:

   ```bash
   certbot --version
   ```

### Step 6: Configure Domain in Nginx

1. Update Nginx configuration to use your domain name:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```

2. Replace the server configuration with domain-specific settings:

   ```nginx
   # HTTP Server - Will be used by Certbot for domain validation
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;  # Replace with your domain
       
       root /var/www/html;
       index index.php index.html index.nginx-debian.html;
       
       # Let's Encrypt challenge location
       location /.well-known/acme-challenge/ {
           root /var/www/html;
       }
       
       # Main application
       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
       
       # PHP processing
       location ~ \.php$ {
           include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
           fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Test and reload Nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

4. Verify your domain is accessible via HTTP:

   ```bash
   curl -I http://yourdomain.com
   ```

### Step 7: Obtain Let's Encrypt Certificate

1. **Register with Let's Encrypt** (required for first-time use):

   ```bash
   sudo certbot register --register-unsafely-without-email --agree-tos --no-eff-email
   ```

   You should see: `Account registered.`

2. **Obtain and install the certificate** (replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain):

   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d yourdomain.com --redirect --non-interactive
   ```

   **Example for DuckDNS domain:**
   ```bash
   sudo certbot --nginx -d contact-php-app.duckdns.org --redirect --non-interactive
   ```

3. If successful, you'll see a message like:

   ```
   Successfully received certificate.
   Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem
   Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem
   This certificate expires on [DATE].
   
   Deploying certificate
   Successfully deployed certificate for yourdomain.com to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default
   Congratulations! You have successfully enabled HTTPS on https://yourdomain.com
   ```

> 💡 **Information**
>
> - **--nginx**: Automatically configures Nginx with the certificate
> - **-d yourdomain.com**: Specifies the domain names for the certificate
> - **--redirect**: Automatically sets up HTTP→HTTPS redirect
> - **--non-interactive**: Avoids prompts (useful for automation)
> - **--register-unsafely-without-email**: Registers without email (optional but functional)
> - Certbot will automatically modify your Nginx configuration
> - The certificate is valid for 90 days and will auto-renew

### Step 8: Configure Secure Nginx Settings for Let's Encrypt

1. After Certbot completes, review the updated Nginx configuration:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   ```

2. Enhance the SSL configuration (Certbot will have created basic SSL settings):

   ```nginx
   # HTTP Server - Redirect to HTTPS
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;
       return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
   }
   
   # HTTPS Server
   server {
       listen 443 ssl http2;
       server_name yourdomain.com www.yourdomain.com;
       
       # Let's Encrypt SSL Certificate (managed by Certbot)
       ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
       ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;
       include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf;
       ssl_dhparam /etc/letsencrypt/ssl-dhparams.pem;
       
       # Enhanced Security Headers
       add_header Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload" always;
       add_header X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN" always;
       add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
       add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
       add_header Referrer-Policy "strict-origin-when-cross-origin" always;
       add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; font-src 'self';" always;
       
       root /var/www/html;
       index index.php index.html index.nginx-debian.html;
       
       # Main application
       location / {
           try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
       }
       
       # PHP processing
       location ~ \.php$ {
           include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
           fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
       }
       
       # phpMyAdmin with enhanced security
       location /phpmyadmin {
           auth_basic "Admin Area";
           auth_basic_user_file /etc/nginx/.htpasswd;
           
           # Additional security for admin area
           add_header X-Robots-Tag "noindex, nofollow, nosnippet, noarchive" always;
           
           root /var/www/html;
           
           location ~ ^/phpmyadmin/(.+\.php)$ {
               try_files $uri =404;
               root /var/www/html;
               include snippets/fastcgi-php.conf;
               fastcgi_pass unix:/var/run/php/php8.1-fpm.sock;
               fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
               include fastcgi_params;
           }
           
           location ~* ^/phpmyadmin/(.+\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|css|png|js|ico|html|xml|txt))$ {
               root /var/www/html;
           }
       }
       
       # Security: Deny access to sensitive files
       location ~ /\.(ht|git|svn) {
           deny all;
       }
   }
   ```

3. Test and reload Nginx:

   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

### Step 9: Set Up Automatic Certificate Renewal

1. Test the renewal process:

   ```bash
   sudo certbot renew --dry-run
   ```

2. If the dry run succeeds, check the automatic renewal timer:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status certbot.timer
   ```

3. Enable the timer if it's not already enabled:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable certbot.timer
   sudo systemctl start certbot.timer
   ```

4. Verify when the next renewal check will occur:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl list-timers | grep certbot
   ```

5. Create a renewal hook to reload Nginx after renewal:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/post/nginx-reload.sh
   ```

6. Add the reload script:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   /usr/bin/systemctl reload nginx
   ```

7. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/post/nginx-reload.sh
   ```

## 🧪 Final Tests

### Test 1: Verify SSL Certificate

1. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - **Self-signed**: `https://<VM_Public_IP>` (will show browser warning)
   - **Let's Encrypt**: `https://yourdomain.com` (should show green lock)

2. Check SSL certificate details:
   - Click the lock icon in your browser
   - Verify certificate information
   - For Let's Encrypt: should show "Certificate (Valid)" with Let's Encrypt as issuer

### Test 2: Test HTTPS Functionality

1. Test your contact form over HTTPS
2. Access phpMyAdmin at `https://yourdomain.com/phpmyadmin`
3. Verify all resources load over HTTPS (no mixed content warnings)

### Test 3: Test HTTP to HTTPS Redirect

1. Try accessing `http://yourdomain.com`
2. Should automatically redirect to `https://yourdomain.com`
3. Verify redirect works for all pages

### Test 4: SSL Security Test

1. Use SSL Labs test to check your SSL configuration:
   ```
   https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=yourdomain.com
   ```

2. Should achieve A or A+ rating for Let's Encrypt setup

✅ **Expected Results**

- HTTPS access works without browser warnings (Let's Encrypt only)
- All HTTP traffic redirects to HTTPS
- Security headers are present in responses
- SSL certificate automatically renews every 90 days
- phpMyAdmin and contact form work securely over HTTPS

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Self-Signed Certificate Issues

If browsers reject the self-signed certificate:
- Verify the Common Name matches your access method (IP or domain)
- Check certificate file permissions: `ls -la /etc/nginx/ssl/`
- Ensure Nginx can read the certificate files

### Let's Encrypt Certificate Issues

If Certbot fails to obtain certificate:
- Verify domain DNS points to your VM: `nslookup yourdomain.com`
- Check domain is accessible: `curl -I http://yourdomain.com`
- Ensure port 80 is open for domain validation
- Check Certbot logs: `sudo tail -f /var/log/letsencrypt/letsencrypt.log`

If automatic renewal fails:
- Test renewal manually: `sudo certbot renew --dry-run`
- Check timer status: `sudo systemctl status certbot.timer`
- Verify renewal hook permissions: `ls -la /etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/post/`

### General SSL Issues

If SSL doesn't work after configuration:
- Test Nginx configuration: `sudo nginx -t`
- Check SSL certificate paths in Nginx config
- Verify firewall allows HTTPS: `sudo ufw status`
- Check Nginx error logs: `sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log`

## 🚀 Optional Challenge

Want to enhance your SSL setup further? Try:

- Implementing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) preloading
- Setting up SSL certificate monitoring and alerts
- Configuring Certificate Transparency monitoring
- Implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Setting up SSL certificate backup and recovery procedures
